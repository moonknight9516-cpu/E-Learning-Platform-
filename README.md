# EduFlow - Premium E-Learning Platform

EduFlow is a professional-grade E-Learning application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Google's Gemini AI. It features a robust course management system, interactive learning paths, progress tracking, and AI-powered educational assistance.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- A Google Gemini API Key (for AI features)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

### Running Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, React Router 7, Tailwind CSS.
- **State Management**: React Context API.
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-3-flash-preview`).
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts.
- **Persistence**: Enhanced LocalStorage API (Mocking a MongoDB/Express backend for immediate runnability within this environment).

## 📖 Core Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login flow.
- **Course Library**: Filterable and searchable catalog covering Computer Science, Medical Science, Development, and Design.
- **Interactive Learning**: Multi-lesson courses with progress tracking and lesson completion status.
- **Dashboard**: Personalized student area with progress bars and learning activity charts.
- **AI Assistant**: 
  - Automated course summaries.
  - Dynamic, lesson-contextual quizzes generated by AI.
- **Admin Panel**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for course management.

## 📡 API Documentation (Mock Layer)

The application uses a service-based architecture in `services/api.ts` that simulates a RESTful API with local persistence.

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticates user by email.
- `POST /api/auth/signup`: Creates a new user profile.

### Courses
- `GET /api/courses`: Returns all courses with support for `search`, `category`, and `difficulty` filters.
- `GET /api/courses/:slug`: Fetches a single course by its URL slug.
- `POST /api/courses`: (Admin Only) Creates a new course.
- `PUT /api/courses/:id`: (Admin Only) Updates an existing course.
- `DELETE /api/courses/:id`: (Admin Only) Deletes a course.

### Enrollments
- `POST /api/enroll`: Enrolls the current user in a course.
- `GET /api/enrollments/:userId`: Fetches all enrollments for a specific user.
- `PUT /api/enrollments/:id/progress`: Updates completion status for a specific lesson and recalculates total progress.

## 🧪 Testing & CI

- **Frontend Tests**: Basic component testing for `CourseCard` and `Dashboard`.
- **Backend Simulation Tests**: Logic validation for progress percentage calculation in `api.ts`.
- **CI**: Configured to run validation checks on push/pull_request.

## 🔐 Admin Credentials

For testing purposes, use the following seed account:
- **Email**: `admin@eduflow.com`
- **Password**: (Mock auth accepts any non-empty string)

## 🌐 Deployment

The frontend is optimized for deployment on platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify**. 
1. Connect your repository.
2. Set the build command to `npm run build`.
3. Set the output directory to `dist`.
4. Ensure the `API_KEY` environment variable is configured in your provider's dashboard.
